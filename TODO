## Known Problems

- `CalculateBoundaries()` doesn't work well when a puppet is flipped.
- In `LoadPuppet()`, a temporary 256-bone buffer is allocated, which causes a crash if a puppet has more than 256 bones.

## TODO

- Redo the filedialog viewport using proper UI.
- Replace the storagebridge viewport with a proper file-explorer-style viewport.
- Workshop viewport:
  - Puppet should be movable.
  - Reference image should be reimplemented:
    - Movable
    - Independently rescalable
    - Proper controls
- Theater viewport:
  - Puppets should be rescalable directly from the viewport, not only via UI.
- Make UI responsive in most viewports (adapt to panel width), especially blocks with 2 or 4 elements.

## New Features

- **Pro Skins**
  - Skins deform with bones using weighted deformation (similar to Blender or DragonBones).

- **Flip-Book**
  - Users can freely draw on each frame, like a classic flipbook.
